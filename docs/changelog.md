# Migrate state files
mv .ralph/*.json .agent/metrics/ 2>/dev/null

# Update configuration
if [ -f "ralph.conf" ]; then
    python -c "
import json
with open('ralph.conf') as f:
    old_config = json.load(f)
# Update keys
old_config['max_iterations'] = old_config.pop('max_iter', 100)
old_config['agent'] = old_config.pop('agent_name', 'auto')
# Save new config
